This Number Guessing Game project is developed as part of the JavaScript BootCamp led by Jonas Schemedtman on Udemy. The game showcases the concept of DOM Manipulation and provides an interactive guessing experience for players.

## Game Overview 📖

In this game, a random number is generated behind the scenes, and the player's task is to guess the number by typing it into the input field. The game interface displays the current score, which starts at 20 ⭐️, and deducts one point for each incorrect attempt.

When the player enters the correct number, the game screen turns green 🟢, and a "Congratulations" message is displayed. The highscore 🏆 is determined by the final score achieved during the game session.

## Gameplay Instructions 🎯

1. Enter your guess in the input field.
2. Click the "Check" button to submit your guess.
3. Receive feedback on whether your guess is too high or too low.
4. Continue guessing until you find the correct number.

## Buttons and Functionality 🧩
